    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What is Wordle?</h2>
    <p className="mb-4">Wordle is a free online word puzzle game where you have six attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word. Each guess provides color-coded feedback to help you get closer to the solution. <a href="/faq" className="text-primary-500 underline">Learn more in our FAQ</a>.</p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Top Tips for Winning at Wordle</h2>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Start with Common Words</h3>
    <p>Begin with a word that uses common letters (like "table" or "crane"). This gives you the best chance to reveal useful hints early.</p>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Use the Color Hints</h3>
    <p>Green means the letter is correct and in the right spot, yellow means the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot, and gray means the letter is not in the word at all. Use this feedback to eliminate possibilities.</p>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Avoid Repeating Letters Early</h3>
    <p>Try not to repeat letters in your first few guesses. This helps you test more unique letters and gather more information quickly.</p>
